                    <p>At the heart of Bite, we want to do better. That means asking ourselves, every day, how we can improve. Whether itâ€™s mindlessly tossing out an 
                    empty toothpaste tube or glossing over the ingredients list, small daily actions can shape the future of our planet. By uncovering how we can be 
                    better to ourselves and to the earth, we are one step closer to a healthier and plastic-free world.</p>
